When you press the "g" key, the browser receives the event and triggers auto-complete functions. These functions generate suggestions based on various factors such as search history, bookmarks, cookies, and popular internet searches. The suggestions are displayed in a dropdown below the URL bar, and they are refined with each subsequent keypress. Depending on your browser's algorithm and browsing mode (private/incognito or regular), different suggestions may be prioritized. In some cases, the browser may even suggest "google.com" before you finish typing it.
